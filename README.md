# VibrationalModes_Troisi_Compact

Notebooks to calculate elastic,inelastic tranmission and currents for Troisi's method.

We use tensors to calculate Green's function calculations and currents to avoid loops. We found that our code is fast given the Hamiltonian of the scattering region is relatively small (20X20).

With the jupyternotebook "ChiralChain_Vibrationalmodes_IETS_MagneticSystem.ipynb" one can calculate first-and second-order differential conductancs and currens.
