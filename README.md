# VibrationalModes_Troisi_Compact

Notebooks to calculate elastic,inelastic tranmission and currents with the method of Troisi, Ratner and Nitzan J. Chem. Phys. 118, 6072â€“6082 (2003) https://doi.org/10.1063/1.1556854

We use tensors to calculate Green's function calculations and currents to avoid loops. We found that our code is fast given the Hamiltonian of the scattering region is relatively small ( smaller than 20X20).

With the jupyternotebook "ChiralChain_Vibrationalmodes_IETS_MagneticSystem.ipynb" one can calculate first-and second-order differential conductancs and currents.
